Our goal is to have a simple single-side staking farm for a limited 30 days period, where the users will lock up/stake $SUPR and then receive rewards for it in $SUPR, proportional to their amount in the farm.

This farm will be live on Rollux, and we'll maintain a somewhat fixed APR by topping up the amount of rewards available on the contract.

Users can either harvest their rewards daily or compound, which will simply re-stake the rewards received, increasing their position in the farm
